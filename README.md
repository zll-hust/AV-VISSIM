# Evaluating Impacts of Public Transit and Automobiles During Connected and Automated Vehicle Adoption

## Introduction

This repo provides the source code and data for the following paper:

Cai, X., Zhou, H., Ma, C.,  Li, X., & Ran, B. (2025). Evaluating impacts of public transit and automobiles during connected automated vehicle adoption. Journal of Advanced Transportation.


This study develops a simulation-based framework using PTV VISSIM to evaluate the equity effects of AV deployment on different income groups. High-income individuals are modeled as relying on private automobiles, while low-income individuals depend on AV-enabled public transit. A detailed case study in Madison, Wisconsin, is developed using PTV VISSIM, incorporating precise lane configurations and traffic light settings derived from empirical data. 

## Usage

Our simulation is conducted using PTV VISSIM 4.3. The VISSIM-related files are located in the folder titled "VISSIM Project Files." Before running the code for different scenarios, please ensure that the corresponding parameters are adjusted according to the details provided in our manuscript.  

Data analysis, primarily for visualization, is performed using Python 3. Before executing the code, please update the input and output file paths as needed.  

Users are advised to confirm that all required software environments and dependencies are properly set up before using this project.
